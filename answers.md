# AI Software Tools Assignment

## Answers

1. **What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?**  
   TensorFlow is an open-source AI and machine learning framework developed by Google.  
   **Key features:**  
   - Supports deep learning and neural networks.  
   - Works on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.  
   - Has built-in tools for AI model training and deployment.  

2. **What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?**  
   - **TensorFlow** uses **static computation graphs** (defined before execution).  
   - **PyTorch** uses **dynamic computation graphs** (built on the fly during execution).  

3. **What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?**  
   Keras is a high-level deep learning API that simplifies model building.  
   It can run on **TensorFlow, Theano, and Microsoft CNTK**.  

4. **What are the key features of Scikit-learn?**  
   - Provides tools for machine learning (classification, regression, clustering).  
   - Includes data preprocessing and model evaluation functions.  
   - Simple and easy to use.  

5. **What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?**  
   Jupyter Notebooks are used for writing and running Python code interactively.  
   **Key features:**  
   - Supports live coding and visualization.  
   - Allows text, code, and images in one document.  
   - Useful for AI, ML, and data analysis.  

6. **In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the `Dropout` layer in the neural network?**  
   The `Dropout` layer helps prevent overfitting by randomly disabling some neurons during training.  

7. **What is the role of the `optimizer` in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?**  
   - The optimizer updates the modelâ€™s weights to improve accuracy.  
   - The most commonly used optimizer is **Adam**.  

8. **In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the `Conv2D` layer?**  
   `Conv2D` is used in **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect patterns like edges and textures in images.  

9. **What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?**  
   - The example likely uses a **classification or regression model**.  
   - A common dataset used is **the Iris dataset** or **MNIST for digits**.  

10. **What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?**  
   - The output is usually a **graph or chart**.  
   - The visualization is generated using **Matplotlib or Seaborn**.
